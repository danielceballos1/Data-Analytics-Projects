Dataset is provided by San Francisco's Department of Public Health.

Context

Dataset contains information on San Francisco's restaurant scores from 2016 to 2019. San Francisco's Health Deparment has created an inspection report and scoring system for facilities within San Francisco. 

After inspecting facilities, health inspectors calculate scores based on the various violations observed. Violations can vary from category. Categories of violations include: 
high risk category: records specific violations that directly relate to the transmission of food borne illnesses, the adulteration of food products and the contamination of food-contact surfaces.
moderate risk category: records specific violations that are of a moderate risk to the public health and safety.
low risk category: records violations that are low risk or have no immediate risk to the public health and safety.



Columns violation_id, violation_description, risk_category were not needed for the following queries so they were removed before being imported into PgAdmin.
